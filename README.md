# PricePredictNeuralNetwork
> This is a simple neural network built to predict a future price based on historical data.

## How to use:
To run, simply open <code>/Executable/</code>, then run <code>NeuralNetConsoleCS.exe</code>. After that, no further input is required and you can just let it compute new generations to make the network better.

> ONLY exit the program if BLUE text isn't getting printed to the screen. Blue text means the program is either saving or loading, and it could corrupt the save data if you quit during this time.

Someday I'll add a networking component to it, that way you won't need to send me the weights file. But in the meantime, goto <code>/Executable/dat/</code>. Then send me the file called <code>weightpersistence.dat</code>.

## The current best weight is: <b>74.71%</b>
Make sure to only send me the weights file if your weight is bigger than this one. I'll keep this up to date with each network evolution.
